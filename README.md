## General Info
![How the home page looks like!](/CMDb.png "Home page")
This website is created as a pair assignment where the task was 
to retrieve information about movies via an API call to OMDb and then 
add these movies to a database via another API call.

The instructions were also that some functionality would be 
available via JavaScript, such as like/dislike functionality, 
show more information about a movie without reloading a page and 
being able to search for movies.

The website is based on a template, link is below [References](#references)
